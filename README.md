# NETFLOX

> NETFLOX is a web application based on an external - here the TV Maze API. The API provides data about TV Shows. We then built the webapp around it. The webapp has 2 user interfaces (pages): The Homepage and the Comment modal. On the Homepage, a list of 6 TV Shows are present, each Show can be `liked` and commented on.
